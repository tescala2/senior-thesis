Galaxy Rotation in EUP Spacetime

When the EUP is applied over a fundamental length scale L_* = 10^13 m, effects should occur for M ≥ 10^6 M_⨀. Here, the theoretical rotation curve of the Milky Way which differs from the flat experimental curves caused by what some believe is dark matter is studied. The Milky Way has a mass and length on the scale of 10^12  M_⨀ and greater than 10^19 m respectively meaning EUP effects are expected to take place which could mimic the effects of dark matter. With the Milky Way’s measured mass of [0.5 ,2.0] × 10^12 M_⨀, the EUP is able to replicate the rotation curves with a mass of [1.12,1.78] × 10^10 M_⨀ for L_* = 0.5 × 10^13 m , [1.77,2.83] × 10^10  M_⨀ for L_* = 10^13 m , and [0.50,0.82] × 10^11 M_⨀ for L_* = 0.5 × 10^14 m.
